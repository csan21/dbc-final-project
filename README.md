2017 Squirrels Cohort

Squad is a mobile-friendly, friend to friend instant polling application. Squad allows you create a list of friends and ask them questions as you're out in the world. The web application was built in Ruby on Rails. Other technologies used were Travis CI, AWS S3, and Twilio API. React Native application is in development.

Currently deployed on [Heroku] (http://dbc-squad.herokuapp.com/)

As our original plan was to build out a full Rails backend utilizing a React Native front end for mobile.  We ran into a few problems in the short time frame, causing us to pivot towards building a mobile-first web app. We were able to get instant phone camera uploads to AWS as well as the swipe feature working on the poll voting page.
